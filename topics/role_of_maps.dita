    <shortdesc>DITA map is a tool to organize DITA topics for output.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>The basic method that DITA uses to express the relationship between topics is through a
                <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/27.0/ug-editor/glossary/ditamap.html"
                format="html" scope="external">DITA map</xref>. Other relationships between topics,
            such as cross references, generally need to be made between topics in the same root map.
            DITA uses maps to determine which topics are part of any output that you create. While
            customized DITA solutions can use other mechanisms, generally DITA is not used as a way
            to publish individual topics. Output is created from a map and includes all the topics
            referenced by the map.</p>
        <p>A publication is always represented by a single map. For instance, if you are writing a
            book, you might use a map to create each chapter and then organize the chapters in a
            main root map to create the book. This helps you to manage your content, offers the
            possibility of reusing maps, and segregates content to support multiple people working
            on the same project. </p>
